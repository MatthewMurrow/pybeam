They both accept three inputs: phi, x, and t. phi, as before, contains the parameters used by your model. The second, x, is the spatial coordinate and corresponds to the accumulator state. The last, t, is time. Thus, both the drift and diffusion rates can have time and spatial dependecies.\n",

If it returns 0, your model has no contamination; if it returns 1, your model is only contamination. This functions only accepts inputs of phi, meaning it can only output a constant value.\n",

    "The second contamination function is contamination_probability. This functions returns the probability of a contamination event occurring at time t. For example, in Tutorial 5, a uniform contamination was added to the model. So, a uniform distribution is required for this function. It accepts inputs of phi and t.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last block of code provides a function for modifying the time step. In general this should not be touched, but it allows for your time step to be made altered in regions where it's hard to accurately obtain the likelihood function. If it outputs 1, the time step is not modified; if it recieves a value of less than 1, the time step will get smaller; if it outputs a value more than 1; the time step will grow. For example, if it returns 0.5, the time step will be one-half of its normal value.\n"
